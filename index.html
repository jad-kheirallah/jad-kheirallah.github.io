“Big Iron” is a song written by Marty Robbins in 1959, a country ballad about an unnamed Arizona Ranger who has a fateful duel with the notorious outlaw Texas Red.

While the encounter itself is likely fiction, the titular “Big Iron” is a real gun, based on one that Robbins saw in a gun shop in Hollywood. It was a one-off custom piece, described as a Great Western copy of the famed Colt Single Action army pistol featuring several unique features, including the backstrap from a Colt 1860 Army and a barrel made from a sawed-down Marlin Rifle.

In the 21st century, the song has once again become popular due to its use in the 2010 post apocalypse/Western RPG Fallout: New Vegas.
